This page outlines Daedalus' Privacy Policy (how it collects and uses your data). This version is effective as of 2026-02-01. If you have any questions or
concerns, please join the support server or email [legal@daedalusbot.xyz](mailto:legal@daedalusbot.xyz).

## 1. Data Provided by You

Any information explicitly provided by you (configuration data) is collected indefinitely and retained for audit logging for your convenience and security.
This information is not viewed by us unless necessary or requested to resolve an issue.

Any information explicitly provided by usage of the service intended to be stored (e.g. moderation actions and notes) will be kept indefinitely.

## 2. Data Required for Functionality

Certain modules will store information in the background as required to function, e.g. storing roles when a member leaves for the
[<Icon icon="arrow-rotate-right" /> Sticky Roles](/modules/sticky-roles) module. This information is retained for as long as is required for functionality.

## 3. Aggregate Data

We will collect aggregate data in order to analyze usage patterns to resolve issues and provide the best experience possible for the service. This includes
metrics such as usage rates and patterns of commands, trigger frequency of automated functionalities, etc.

## 4. Removal of Data

You may contact us through our support server in order to request complete removal of you or your server's data. Note that not all data related to your account
can be removed; for example, if your account has notes written by moderators in a server using Daedalus, we cannot remove that data upon your request, but can
upon the server owner's request.
