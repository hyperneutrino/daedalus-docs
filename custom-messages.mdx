title: "Custom Messages"
---

Custom messages allow you to configure dynamic messages to send to users for things such as supporter announcements or welcome messages. They are also used for
stats channels.

This guide goes over the mechanics of dynamic custom messages, not how to write a good one; that is up to your personal style.

## Basic Format

The basic format for dynamic custom messages is to insert a command block using `{...}`. For example, to mention the user in a welcome message, simply use
`{mention}`.

Some commands also manipulate other values. For example, `{members}` evaluates to the number of members in the server, so to show "you are the Nth member", you
can do `{ordinal {members}}`. Here, `ordinal` is a function that accepts a number and outputs the ordinal format ("Nth") for it.

To insert a literal <code>&#123;</code>, just write <code>\\&#123;</code>.

All values are strings (text), numbers, or lists of values. Boolean (yes/no) values are represented as `1` for true and `0` for false.

## Members

If the context targets a server member (e.g. supporter announcements, welcome messages), the following functions are available:

- `{avatar}` -- the member's server-specific avatar if present and their global user avatar otherwise
- `{nickname}` -- the member's nickname if set and their global display name otherwise
- `{banner}` -- the member's server-specific banner if present, otherwise their global user banner if present, otherwise `""`
- `{booster?}` -- whether or not the member is boosting the server

## Members & Users

If the context targets a server member or a user, the following functions are available:

- `{mention}` -- mention the user (note that this only pings in certain contexts)
- `{display-name}` -- the user's global display name
- `{username}` -- the user's username (i.e. their handle)
- `{tag}` -- the user's tag (for user accounts, this is their username; for bots, this is its username and discriminator e.g. `Daedalus#1821`)
- `{discriminator}` -- the user's discriminator as a string (for user accounts, this is `""`; for bots, this is the four numbers at the end of its tag e.g.
  `1821` for Daedalus)
- `{user-banner}` -- the user's banner URL if present and `""` otherwise
- `{user-avatar}` -- the user's global avatar
- `{bot?}` -- whether or not the user is a bot account

## Roles

If the context targets a role (e.g. supporter announcements that detect a role), the following functions are available:

- `{role-icon}` -- the role's icon URL
- `{role-members}` -- the number of members with the role
- `{role-name}` -- the name of the role
- `{hoist?}` -- whether or not the role is hoisted (a role is hoisted if its members are displayed separately from other users)

## Guilds

The server is always in context, so the following functions are always available:

- `{server}` -- the server's name
- `{members}` -- the number of members in the server
- `{boosts}` -- the number of boosts (not the number of boosting members)
- `{tier}` -- the boost tier (level) of the server (0, 1, 2, or 3)
- `{server-icon}` -- the server's icon URL
- `{server-banner}` -- the server's banner URL
- `{server-splash}` -- the server's discovery splash image URL
- `{bots}` -- the number of bots in the server
- `{humans}` -- the number of non-bot accounts in the server
- `{boosters}` -- the number of boosting members (not the number of boosts)

## Functions

The following functions are globally available to manipulate the above values. Arguments surrounded by `[]` are optional. `...` means any number of arguments
may be provided.

- `{countdown x y z}` -- if `x` as a date is in the past, `z`, otherwise `y` formatted as a countdown (`%WDHM%` gets replaced with the remaining time formatted
  into weeks, days, hours, and minutes, and any combination of `WDHM` are possible, e.g. `%DH%` only shows days and hours)
- `{? x y [z]}` -- if `x` is true (non-empty string or non-zero number), `y`, otherwise `z` (or `""` if `z` is not defined)
- `{!= ...}` -- whether or not all provided arguments are unique
- `{random ...}` -- randomly choose one of the given values (at least one must be provided)
- `{list ...}` -- create a list from the provided values
- `{! x}` -- `0` if `x` is true (non-empty string or non-zero number), otherwise `1`
- `{length x}` -- the length of a list
- `{ordinal #}` -- the "Nth" form of a number (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) (works for negative numbers)
- `{join x y}` -- joins a list of strings (`x`) on a string (`y`)
- `{+ ...}` -- sum the provided values (at least one must be provided)
- `{- ...}` -- chain subtraction: `{- x y z}` returns `x - y - z` (at least one must be provided)
- `{* ...}` -- take the product of the provided values (at least one must be provided)
- `{/ ...}` -- chain division: `{/ x y z}` returns `x / y / z = (x / y) / z` (at least one must be provided)
- `{\ ...}` -- chain floor division: `{\ 5 2}` returns `2` rather than `2.5` (at least one must be provided)
- `{# x}` -- the length of a list
- `{# x ...}` -- index access of a list: `{# x 1 2 3}` returns `x[1][2][3]` (zero-indexed)
- `{% ...}` -- chain modulo (remainder after division): `{% 7 3}` is `1` (at least one must be provided)
- `{^ ...}` -- left-to-right chain exponentiation: `{^ x y z}` returns `(x ^ y) ^ z` (at least one must be provided)
- `{&& ...}` -- logical AND (the first false value if any, the last value if all are true) (at least one must be provided)
- `{|| ...}` -- logical OR (the first true value if any, the last value if all are false) (at least one must be provided)
- `{++ ...}` -- concatenate lists together (at least one must be provided)
- `{= ...}` -- whether or not all provided arguments are equal and at least one argument was provided
- `{> ...}` -- whether all provided values are in strictly descending order
- `{>= ...}` -- whether all provided values are in non-ascending order
- `{< ...}` -- whether all provided values are in strictly ascending order
- `{<= ...}` -- whether all provided values are in non-descending order
