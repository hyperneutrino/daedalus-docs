title: "Moderation"

<Tip>This module requires permissions for some of its commands but does not require any special permissions itself.</Tip>

The moderation module includes the usual suite of moderation commands. Refer to the command references. There are some settings that you can configure.

By default, moderation commands are publicly visible (both the confirmation prompt, which can only be confirmed by the original executor, and the follow-up
notice). You can configure them to be visible only to the user using the command in specific channels or everywhere.

By default, massbans (see `/massban`) only require confirmation from the user executing the command. You can configure an approval threshold, which requires
approval from the specified number of users who have permission to use `/massban`, and bypass roles, which allow users with any of those roles to bypass the
approval requirement. Note that the original submitter must confirm the massban regardless of approval count/bypassing.

You can configure the duration for the Daedalus mod view's instant timeout button. This button immediately times out the viewed member for the specified
duration and allows for quickly shutting down an issue and adding mod notes and determining the correct course of action afterwards.
