title: "Reaction Roles"
---

<Note>This module requires the **Manage Roles** permission.</Note>

The reaction roles module lets you set up role prompts to allow users to self-assign roles. Before using this, consider setting up Discord's built-in
onboarding instead. While it does not work for all applications, the interface is a lot easier because it is built in to the client and allows members to
immediately see the roles reflected on a preview of their profile.

Despite the name, reactions are not the recommended way to set up role prompts. With Discord components (buttons and dropdowns), members will receive a
response confirming the changes or informing them of any errors, which allows for a more interactive interface. It is also much easier for users to understand
the options since button/dropdown labels are available.

## Adding to Existing Messages

You may wish to choose to use reactions despite our recommendations. If you want to add the reactions to an existing message (it can be any message such as an
externally configured webhook message, though keep in mind that you can customize the prompt message sent by Daedalus as well), you can enable the **add
reactions to existing message** toggle, which makes Daedalus add the reactions to the targeted message (enter its ID) instead of sending one itself. This can
be especially useful for retrofitting Daedalus onto existing prompt messages without disturbing message order within the channel.

Note that this setting can only be changed when creating a new prompt.

## Assignment Types

The assignment type determines the possible role configurations:

- `normal` -- members can add/remove any of the roles available on the prompt
- `unique` -- members can only choose exactly zero or one of the roles
- `add-only` -- members can only add roles available on the prompt and cannot remove them later (useful for verification/agreement roles)
- `remove-only` -- members can only remove roles available on the prompt (useful for verification/agreement configurations with inverted/lockout roles)
    - note that these roles will not be added by default -- you may consider the [<Icon icon="bolt" /> Autoroles](/modules/autoroles) module for automatically
      assigning them to members when they join
- `locked` -- members can only choose exactly one of the roles and cannot remove the role or change their selection later
