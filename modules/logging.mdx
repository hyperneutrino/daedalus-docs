<Note>This module requires the **View Audit Logs** permission and its behavior may be improved with the **Manage Webhooks** permission.</Note>

The logging module lets you log events/changes in your server.

## Ignored Channels

You can ignore certain channels at the top-level. Any channel-specific events that happen in any of these channels will not be logged no matter what. If you
want to ignore specific event types, configure the overrides instead.

Some events are not channel-specific and are not subject to this. For example, message deletions are channel-specific but bans are not.

## File-Only Mode

File-only mode only affects logs for message edits and deletions. When this is enabled, message deletions will only be logged if the message contained files
and only the files (i.e. not the content) will be logged and message edits will only log files being removed from a message.

## Override Logic

When an event occurs, it will recursively look for what to do based on the defined rules. Channel-specific events can be configured with channel-based
overrides (for example, you can configure message deletions in NSFW channels to be sent to a separate logging channel).

If a match action or the default action is specified for an event, it will follow through with that. For example, setting "do nothing" for admin channels in
the message deletion event will silence logs for messages being deleted in your admin channels. If the matched action is "default to parent", it will continue
looking for what to do based on the event category.

You can match events based on whether the channel is in or not in a list of channels, of or not of certain channel types, and is or is not NSFW
(age-restricted).

You can do the same for event categories. Note that channel-based matches for event categories will be ignored for events that are not channel-specific. For
example, although the server changes category is defined as channel-based, editing a role is not channel-based, so category channel match rules will not apply.

Finally, you can set match rules for all logging events in the base settings, which will apply if the event-level and category-level rules both returned
"default to parent". The same note as above applies -- events that are not channel-based that reach this point will simply use the default action.

## Common Configuration

A common configuration will be to have a channel for each logging category and then set the default action for each category to output to that channel.

## Outputting to Webhooks

In most cases, outputting to a webhook is not going to be noticeably different from outputting to a channel. However, there are two important things you can do
with this.

1. If you set the webhook to a webhook outside of the server, you can have your logging in a different server. Note that you need to put a `!` in front of the
   URL to confirm that you want to do this (by default, this is not allowed as a safety measure).
2. Bots and bot-created webhooks can only send emoji from their servers. User-created webhooks are not subject to this restriction, so if you output to a
   webhook, all emoji will be able to be logged, which can be helpful for message and reaction logging.
