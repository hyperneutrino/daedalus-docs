title: "Automod"
---

<Note>
    This module requires the following permissions depending on how it's configured:
    <ul>
        <li>**Manage Messages** -- if any rules are set up to delete the offending message(s)</li>
        <li>**Manage Roles** -- if any rules are set up to mute the author as an additional action</li>
        <li>**Moderate Members** -- if any rules are set up to time out the author as an additional action</li>
        <li>**Kick Members** -- if any rules are set up to kick the author as an additional action</li>
        <li>**Ban Members** -- if any rules are set up to ban the author as an additional action</li>
    </ul>
</Note>

The automod module lets you automatically scan new/edited messages and take action against messages that match certain filters.

## Universal Settings

You can mark channels as ignored to stop automod from scanning messages within those channels by default. You can specify per-rule whether or not to disregard
the default ignored channels.

You can mark roles as ignored to stop automod from scanning messages from users with those roles. You can specify per-rule whether or not to disregard the
default ignred roles.

You can set a default report channel to which automod actions will be logged. This can be overridden per-rule.

The **interact with webhooks** setting determines whether or not automod should scan webhook messages. If you use services like PluralKit, Tupperbox, Octocon,
NQN, etc. that allow users to send messages through webhook, you should enable this setting so that members cannot circumvent your automod using those
services. Note that this is a double-edged sword -- Daedalus cannot determine the reason for a webhook message being sent, so people with ignored roles will
be unable to send proxied messages.

## Rules

Each rule comes with a match configuration, an action, and restrictions.

### Match Configuration

The following rule types are available:

- `blocked terms` -- detect messages containing forbidden words/phrases
- `repeated characters` -- detect messages containing the same character repeated too many times in a row
- `emoji spam` -- detect messages containing too many emoji
- `ratelimit`<sup>&dagger;</sup> -- detect when a user sends messages too frequently
- `attachment spam`<sup>&dagger;</sup> -- detect when a user sends files too frequently (optionally also if they send too many files in one message)
- `sticker spam`<sup>&dagger;</sup> -- detect when a user sends stickers too frequently
- `link spam`<sup>&dagger;</sup> -- detect when a user sends links too frequently (optionally also if they send too many links in one message)
- `mention spam`<sup>&dagger;</sup> -- detect when a user sends user/role mentions too frequently, too many mentions in one message, or tries to ping
  **@everyone** or **@here** without having the requisite permission
- `invite links` -- detect when a user sends an invite link to a blocked/disallowed server
- `blocked links` -- detect when a user sends a URL from a blocked domain

<sub>
    <sup>&dagger;</sup>These rules will match all messages that were part of determining the rate of actions. If the rule is configured to delete the offending
    message, it will delete all matched messages.
</sub>

### Actions

Each rule can be configured with the following actions:

- `report to channel` -- if true (default), report to the specified channel
- `delete message` -- delete the offending message (or for ratelimit rules, all offending messages)
- `notify author` -- notify the author that their message was flagged (also informs them what other actions were taken)
- `override report channel` -- send alerts from this rule to the specified channel, or if not set, the default report channel
- `additional action` -- specify an additional action to do on top of the above (all except "do nothing" are logged to the user's history)
- `action duration` -- if the additional action is to mute, timeout, or ban, you may (or for timeouts, must) specify the duration of the punishment

### Restrictions

Each rule can be configured with the following match restrictions:

- `disregard default ignored channels` -- treat the universal ignored channels setting as though it were empty (match messages in all channels that aren't
  ignored by this rule)
- `disregard default ignored roles` -- treat the universal ignored roles setting as though it were empty (match messages from all users who aren't ignored by
  this rule)
- `only watch enabled channels` -- only match messages in channels that are explicitly watched by this rule and ignore channels by default
- `only watch enabled roles` -- only match messages from users with a role that is explicitly watched by this rule and ignore others by default

Additionally, you can set per-rule ignored/watched channels/roles. If a message is in a watched channel, it will be matched even if the universal setting says
to ignore that channel. Likewise, if a message is sent by a user with a watched role, it will be matched even if the universal setting says to ignore them
based on their roles.

However, a message is ignored if it is in a watched channel but from a user with a universally ignored role or vice versa.
