title: "Supporter Announcements"

<Tip>This module does not require any special permissions.</Tip>

The supporter announcements module lets you send messages when members support your server.

You can watch for support via boosting or role assignment. If you select "detect boosts", the announcement will trigger when a member goes from being a
non-booster to a booster (that is, it does not trigger if a member adds boosts while already boosting). If you select "detect roles", the announcement will
trigger whenever a member gains the specific role for any reason.

Some platforms (such as Ko-Fi) have their own integrations that allow automatically assigning roles for supporters, which you can integrate with Daedalus for
announcements. You can also set up supporter roles via server subscriptions/products using built-in Discord monetization.

Additionally, you can create linked roles in a role's settings, which makes the role automatically managed based on certain conditions (e.g. requiring a
verified domain). This does not really allow you to detect supporters, but you can integrate with it nonetheless.

Note that these messages have pings enabled, so any user/role mentions in your custom messages will ping the relevant parties (if the bot has permission to).
