title: "Sticky Roles"
---

<Note>This module requires the **Manage Roles** permission.</Note>

The sticky roles module lets you save members' roles when they leave the server and re-apply them automatically when they join.

Note that this is not necessary for the mute role, which is already automatically applied if the user joins while the bot recalls that they are muted.

It is recommended to exclude/not include the following roles:

- the mute role -- if it is included, then if a user leaves the server while muted, becomes unmuted, and rejoins, they will receive the mute role again
- roles added/removed by XP level-up rewards -- if it is included, then XP changes while the user is gone (which can happen by resetting XP or importing XP
  from another source) may not reflect properly
- roles added by the account filter -- if they are included, then if a user joins while their account is new, receives the new member roles, leaves, and
  rejoins after their account is older, they will still have the new member roles
