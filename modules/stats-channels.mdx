title: "Stats Channels"
---

<Note>This module requires the **Manage Channels** permission in the specified stats channels.</Note>

The stats channels module lets you set up select channels to have automatically updating names, which can be used to track stats (e.g. member count) or
countdowns.

It is recommended to use voice channels as stats channels. If you set their permissions to disallow everyone from connecting, they will be visible while not
allowing members to click into them, which improves the user experience (a visible read-only text channel would still allow users to navigate to it).
Additionally, text channel names are a lot less flexible, so your stats channel name may not show up as expected as a text channel.
