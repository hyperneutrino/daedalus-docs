title: "Autoroles"

<Note>This module requires the **Manage Roles** permission.</Note>

The autoroles module lets you automatically add certain roles to all joining members (whether they were former members or not). This can be useful for
assigning a manually removed new member role or one removed by a reaction role. Consider the following:

- If you only want to apply a new member role to accounts that were created within a certain recent time period, that can be done with the
  [<Icon icon="filter" /> Account Filter](/modules/account-filter) module.
- If the role is automatically removed at a certain XP level, do not need to set it here. The XP module automatically syncs members' reward roles when they
  join the server and applying it as an autorole will cause it to be added to high-level users who leave and rejoin.
