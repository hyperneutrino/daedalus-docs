title: "Custom Roles"
---

<Note>This module requires the **Manage Roles** permission.</Note>

The custom roles module lets select users create their own custom roles. This is mainly useful as an incentive to boost/support the server, though you can also
enable it for **@everyone** in smaller friend servers if you just want everyone to be able to easily set up their own display roles.

Note that a server can only have up to 250 roles, so keep that in mind when determining how available to make this feature.
