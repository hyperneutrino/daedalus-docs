title: "Starboard"

<Tip>This module does not require any special permissions.</Tip>

The starboard module features messages that receive enough stars (or another specified reaction).

You can specify a reaction to detect instead of <Icon icon="star" />, a default starboard channel (where starred messages are forwarded), and a
threshold (the number of users that must react with the specified reaction to mark a message as featured).

You can also set overrides for channels and control their output and threshold. If an override is disabled, then messages in that channel will never be sent
to a starboard channel (messages in any potential starboard output channel are inherently ignored). The threshold and output channel for a message are
determined by looking for the override for its channel, then its parent, then so on, and falling back to the global default.

For example, if your **#general** channel has an override threshold of 10 stars and your **General** category has an override output of **#starboard-2**, then
messages in **#general** will require 10 stars and will be forwarded to **#starboard-2**.

If a message in an NSFW channel would be starred and its output points to a non-NSFW channel, it will be ignored.
