title: "Premium & Custom Clients"
---

Daedalus Premium and Custom Clients subscriptions are purchased through [Stripe](https://stripe.com). Billing is handled by Stripe and your payment information
is processed by them, a reputable payment processor. Daedalus never sees your payment information, though your customer name, email, country, and the last four
digits of your card number (if applicable) are visible through Stripe. This information is never used except when absolutely necessary, e.g. to email you in
case of payment-related issues.

When you purchase a subscription, you will have the option to choose between annual and monthly billing. Once you pay through Stripe, it should immediately be
reflected in your account settings. Premium will not be granted to a server; instead, you must provision a key and either give it to a server admin or use it
yourself.

To activate premium or a custom client, go to your server's settings and redeem it in the **Premium** section. If you receive a premium key from a support
agent or through a promotion, you can activate it here as well.

## Using Custom Clients

The custom clients feature allows you to run Daedalus through a custom bot account. This lets you control the bot's avatar, banner, about me, etc. Here's what
you need to consider before using custom clients.

- Modmail behavior is improved when using custom clients. Normally, members need to DM **Daedalus#1821** and need to select the server or confirm which server
  they want to message each time, and having multiple open modmail threads can get confusing. With a custom client, they only need to confirm their message
  each time instead.
- Reaction role prompts, ticket prompts, and any other interactive messages sent by the bot must be set up again when switching clients since bots cannot see
  or respond to interactions between users and other bots' messages. You can simply go to the relevant module's settings and click "Save", which validates the
  prompts and sends them if they are missing.
- You should kick any clients you are not using as they pollute the command list (when you switch to a custom client, kick **Daedalus#1821**, and if you switch
  back, kick the custom client unless you plan to overwrite its commands or repurpose it yourself).
- We don't officially recommend running another bot through the same client as a Daedalus custom client as it can cause interference and we cannot take
  responsibility for any issues or damage caused as we cannot guard against it. If you wish to do so anyway, please read the [cohosting guide](/cohosting) and
  make sure you are following the [Terms of Service](/terms).
