title: "/unmute"
---

<Note>By default, this command requires the **Moderate Members** permission. This command requires the bot to have the **Manage Roles** permission.</Note>

Unmute a member by removing the mute role (must be configured in your server settings). This fails if they are not muted. If they are not in the server, the
recorded mute will be removed and they will no longer receive the mute role upon joining.

## Syntax

```
/unmute <user> [reason] [private-notes] [silent]
```
