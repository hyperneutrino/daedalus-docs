<Note>
    By default, this command requires the **Manage Server** and **Ban Members** permissions. This command requires the bot to have the **Ban Members**
    permission.
</Note>

Massban users by providing a list of user IDs directly to the bot. If configured, this requires either a set number of approvals or someone with a bypass role
to skip approval. Users will not be notified.
