title: "/massban export"
---

<Note>
    By default, this command requires the **Manage Server** and **Ban Members** permissions. This command requires the bot to have the **Ban Members**
    permission (this is because it is part of `/massban`, not because it actually bans members).
</Note>

Create a massban export by providing a list of user IDs. This will save the user list and output an export key which can be sent to others to be used via
`/massban import`.

## Syntax

```
/massban export <users>
```

| Parameter | Information                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `users`   | A comma/space-separated list of user IDs to ban. |
