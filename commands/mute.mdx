<Note>By default, this command requires the **Moderate Members** permission. This command requires the bot to have the **Manage Roles** permission.</Note>

Mute a member by assigning them the mute role (must be configured in your server settings). If they are not in the server, the mute will be recorded and they
will receive the mute role upon joining.

| Parameter       | Information                                                                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `user`          | The user to mute.                                                                                                           |
| `reason`        | The reason to log and send to the user.                                                                                     |
| `private-notes` | A private reason to log (not sent to the user).                                                                             |
| `duration`      | If specified, the user will be unmuted after this duration. Muting them again with a different duration will override this. |
| `silent`        | If true, the user will not be notified of their mute.                                                                       |
