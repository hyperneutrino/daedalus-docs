<Note>By default, this command requires the **Ban Members** permission. This command requires the bot to have the **Ban Members** permission.</Note>

Ban a user from the server. If they are not in the server, this will still prevent them from rejoining/joining in the future. If they are already banned, this
will unban them and re-ban them to purge messages according to the specified purge duration. They will be automatically unbanned after the specified duration
(if applicable) so long as Daedalus is in the server, even if the Moderation module is disabled.

/ban <user> [reason] [private-notes] [duration] [purge-duration] [silent]

| `reason`         | The reason to log and send to the user.                                                                                       |
