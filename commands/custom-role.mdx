    Permissions for this command are controlled by the [<Icon icon="eye-dropper" /> Custom Roles](/modules/custom-roles) module configuration. It also requires
    the bot to have the **Manage Roles** permission.
</Note>

Open the custom role configuration menu. If you don't have one, you can create one with a single click. If you have one, you can delete it and edit its name,
color(s), and icon (if available) with an interactive menu.
