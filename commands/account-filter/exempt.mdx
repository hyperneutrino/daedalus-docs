title: "/account-filter exempt"
---

<Note>By default, this command requires the **Manage Server** permission.</Note>

Make a user exempt from the account filter. This stops Daedalus from applying your account filter action to them. Note that this is only particularly useful
if the action is set to kick, as otherwise you can simply unmute them, remove their timeout, or remove the new member role(s). This fails if the user's account
is already exempt or if it is more than 28 days old (the maximum threshold for the account filter).

## Syntax

```
/account-filter exempt <user>
```

| Parameter | Information              |
| --------- | ------------------------ |
| `user`    | The user to make exempt. |
