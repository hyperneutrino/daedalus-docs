Thank you for choosing Daedalus. The aim of this bot is to support your vision for your server with enough flexibility to be used however you'd like while
being straightforward enough for admins of all levels of experience.

## Guidance

Most commands are fairly intuitive. You can find a full list of them [here](/modules) with information about each module and command.

The module list also provides you with a list of permissions that the bot requires in order to work. It is recommended to only give the bot permissions that it
needs, and the permission list lets you determine which permissions are required. When adding the bot via [/install](https://daedalusbot.xyz/install), you
should have had the option to add the bot with custom permissions. If you added the bot before this feature was added, you can edit its bot role in your server
settings or re-invite it.
