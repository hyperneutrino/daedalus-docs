Thank you for choosing Daedalus. We hope we can support your vision for your server and provide the flexibility and simplicity needed to fit your needs

the [support server](https://discord.gg/7TRKfSK7EU) and either send a message in the appropriate channel or DM Daedalus for more private inquiries.

Please see the [security page](/security) for reporting security-related bugs.

## Guidance

Most commands are fairly intuitive. You can find a full list of them [here](/modules) with information about each module and command.

The module list also provides you with a list of permissions that the bot requires in order to work. It is recommended to only give the bot permissions that it
needs, and the permission list lets you determine which permissions are required. When adding the bot via [/install](https://daedalusbot.xyz/install), you
should have had the option to add the bot with custom permissions. If you added the bot before this feature was added, you can edit its bot role in your server
settings or re-invite it.

## Tech Stack

This bot was written in the [Bun JavaScript Runtime](https://bun.sh/) using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/). The dashboard is made using
[Astro](https://astro.build/) and [React](https://react.dev/). The backend uses [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) and stores its data in a
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database. This documentation is powered by [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/).

Everything is hosted on a VPS at [Contabo](https://contabo.com/).
