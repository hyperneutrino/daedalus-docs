We take security very seriously. If you find any issues that may affect security, please disclose them responsibly via
[security@daedalusbot.xyz](mailto:security@daedalusbot.xyz). Exploiting or intentionally withholding information about security vulnerabilities will result in
termination of access to the service.

## What is a state mismatch?

You may have encountered the "state mismatch" page when attempting to log in. Here's a quick summary of the login process:

1. When you click "log in", we generate a `state` variable and store it in your cookies. This does not identify you in any way, it is a security measure for
   later steps.
2. We send you to Discord to authenticate (with the `state`), where Discord will check that you want to grant us permission to get the following:
    1. Your username, avatar, and banner — This is part of the `identify` scope, which is necessary to determine who you are. Without this information, it is
       impossible to provide the dashboard features.
    2. What servers you're in — This is part of the `guilds` scope, which is necessary to get the server list in the "Manage Servers" list.
3. If you authorize us, Discord redirects you back to us with a `token` and a `state`. Here, we check that the `state` given from the redirect is the same as
   the `state` stored in your cookies. This is only possible if you started from our website.
4. If your `state` matches, we exchange the `token` with Discord to get an access and refresh token for your account. This token allows us (and only us) to
   access the authorized information.

The `state` prevents a malicious third-party from gaining access to Daedalus through your account, which could allow them to read or change your settings.
If they attempt to log you in (which they can do by simply redirecting you to the Discord OAuth login link), they would not be able to match the `state` in the
Discord link with the `state` we track.

Discord requires the developer to list every possible redirect link, so if you authorize our bot, you will only ever be redirected to our website, as it is
impossible for a third-party to tell Discord to redirect to them (Discord will reject the request).
