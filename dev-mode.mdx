title: "Dev Mode"
---

<p>
    At the top of each module's configuration page, you will see a switch for entering developer mode (import/export mode). You can also use
    <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> to switch between the two modes.
</p>

In dev mode, you can edit the configuration directly via [YAML](https://yaml.org/). You can copy-paste this configuration to other servers, though you will
need to update any IDs (e.g. channels and roles). The intention of this feature is to make sharing configurations easier, so feel free to publicize YAML
templates using this or create third-party tools for generating configurations.

When copy-pasting configurations with UUIDs (internal IDs used to track things like reaction role prompts, automod rules, etc.), you do not need to replace the
UUIDs. Although they are called UUIDs (universally unique identifiers), it is not necessary for them to be unique between servers. If you wish to clone an
object, you will need to generate a new UUID. You can do this by switching off of dev mode, opening the cloned object, and clicking "fix UUID error". You can
also insert an arbitrary UUID in the new object. It does not need to be random as long as it is unique, but it does need to be a valid UUIDv4.
